    <h1>Skills</h1>

	<p>There are several skills that I have acquired that I will discuss. In my high school years I have learned to play several different types of instruments.<sup>1</sup> These are bandurria, octavina, double-bass, guitar, laud.<sup>2</sup> Bandurria is the easiest to play and I can play a song with this instrument without a music score and just by hearing.<sup>3</sup> I can also transpose a music score as I did before in my club.<sup>4</sup> I can also learn something very fast if I have the necessary resources that I need.<sup>5</sup> If needed, I can converse with anyone regardless of their status in life.<sup>6</sup> Additionally I’m a great listener and observer that sometimes I notice the things that people don’t usually take notice of and appreciate it.<sup>7</sup> I can do simple programming.<sup>8</sup> I can adapt to changes quickly and blend in to the environment.<sup>9</sup> I can sing some opm and pop songs that are deeper than my voice.<sup>10</sup> I can also write and read the korean letter system called hangeul.<sup>11</sup> When conversing with other people, I can usually get an information from them without directly asking.<sup>12</sup> I can also cook fried foods.<sup>13</sup>

	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	
	<p>In my free time one of the things that I do is read graphic novels.<sup>1</sup> The one that I read is called webtoon where it's all vertically aligned and read from top to bottom.<sup>2</sup> Unlike a normal comic, this one is specifically made for “web” and gadgets.<sup>3</sup> Moreover I enjoy playing games like persona, final fantasy, and rhythmic games.<sup>4</sup> Sometimes, I make my own art.<sup>5</sup> That involves pixel art that I made by referencing real life things and creating from my own imagination.<sup>6</sup> I also play my instruments and practice different songs to further improve my skills.<sup>7</sup> I combine my games and my instruments as a way to practice in a fun way.<sup>8</sup> Frequently I browse various websites and forums to be updated with the latest trends.<sup>9</sup> I make songs when I feel a little bit artistic.<sup>10</sup> Meditating and staring blankly at nature are the ones that I got to do most frequently. <sup>11</sup>
	</p>
	
	<h1>Interests</h1>
	
	<p>I’m very interested in manga and webtoon novels.<sup>1</sup> I read mostly about psychological thriller stories which made me finish the whole novel as soon as I got hooked in.<sup>2</sup> I love playing games, specifically decision making games.<sup>3</sup> It made me think about my choices in real life and that every choice that I make has its own consequences whether it's small or big.<sup>4</sup> I’m also interested in what is there beyond what we can see.<sup>5</sup> How stars and other things might still be undiscovered and humans are like tiny specks of dust.<sup>6</sup> I’m also interested in how we came to be or the existence of everything.<sup>7</sup> I like cute and cool things.<sup>8</sup> I'm interested with how the behavior of the people changes as the world also changes along them.<sup>9</sup> Unique creatures also piqued my interest. <sup>10</sup>
